# US-Weather-Tracker

-I added the needed links to create the webpage

-I created the html and css styles to the page 

-I attached the API key for the weather information

-I created a fetch function to grab the weather data to display on the page

-I created a for loop to display the future forcast for every 3 hours

I saved the search history into local storage, and made llod to retrieve save that info on the page.

-I created HTML for the 5-day forcast, then commented it out once it was linked in the JavaScript.  I left the comments there in case I needed them later for a reference,
